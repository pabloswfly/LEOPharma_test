# LEO Pharma Test
This is my submitted solution for the evaluation test on gene expression for a student position in LEO Pharma pharmaceutical company.

The code was writen in R and the document was compiled with Markdown. 

The test consisted in the management, analysis and visualization of microarray expression data from patients with Atopic Dermatitis disease.
The dataset used is GSE58558 from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).
